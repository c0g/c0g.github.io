#### Electric Gaia

###### Distributed Inference

It's an oft repeated fallacy that people use 10% of their brains, when actually this is only true for people who repeat it. What is universally true however that the power in today's mobile phones is mindblowing, when compared to even powerful desktop computers of a few years ago. Modern Androids and iPhones have enough local processing power to do worthwhile inference, and we need algorithms and applications to use it for more than just porcine physics simulation.

###### Cheapening Science

Products like the [SensorDrone](http://sensordrone.com) give ordinary people (like you!) a chance to do real science. They also give scientists the chance to get free work. I'm looking into just what we can infer using the commond or garden Google Nexus 4 and a simple SensorDrone. Have an idea? Let me know!

#### Agentswitch

I did some work on the ORCHID project's AgentSwitch project, which aims to help people reduce their energy costs. We used a Gaussian Process (do you notice a trend in the things I'm working on here?) to extrapolate people's energy usage into the future. 

The really useful thing we got from the GP framework compared to simpler, faster methods was the variance readings. A high variance on the prediction means there's something wrong - we shouldn't put much trust in the prediction.
