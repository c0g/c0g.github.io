#### Electric Gaia

###### Distributed Inference

It is a [widely believed fact](/lie.html)that people only use 10% of their brains. What is universally true however is that the power in today's mobile phones is mindblowing and criminally underused, even when compared to even powerful desktop computers of a few years ago. Modern Androids and iPhones have enough local processing power to do worthwhile inference, and we need algorithms and applications to use it for more than just porcine physics simulation.

###### Cheapening Science

Products like the [SensorDrone](http://sensordrone.com) give ordinary people (like you!) a chance to do real science. They also give scientists the chance to get free work. I'm looking into just what we can infer using the commond or garden Google Nexus 4 and a simple SensorDrone. Have an idea? Let me know!

#### Agentswitch

I did some work on the ORCHID project's AgentSwitch project, which aims to help people reduce their energy costs.
