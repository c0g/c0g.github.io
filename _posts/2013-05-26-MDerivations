Steve asked me to go into more detail about the maths I used to derive that beautiful video in my last post

The overall intention of this work is a small extension to GPGO - in GPGO it was possible to sample at any point in the objective function, and samples where guaranteed tobe carried out atthe intened place. In a citizen science application,we don't reall have the guarantee. An agent  (in this case a guy with a phone) may not be able to guarantee they will alwys follow the sampling instruciton precisely, nor are they willing to trek a long ditance to make the measurement. They are constrained in the space they are willing to measure, and in their ability to get aget to a region of space. 

We began by considering a very simple form of the problem. We modelled an agent which was capable of movinga single unit of space in each time space (call it one meter per second). . Waht this bmeant was that the set of possible fture locationwas rawn from the unit circle surrounding the current location. The agent had an uncertain cntrol system . It's future position, once it had an ideal end location, was relaed by a probaility distirubtion $p(z \mid c)$. 

The agent's aim was to optimize some objective function in the 2d space in which it lived. In the initial videos this was a local minimization - further development have mad it a global optiimizer, We useda GP to represent the agent's view of the objective function,.

To simplify the mathsmeatics, we made use of a GP with a normal RBF covariance function_and_ ensured that the agent's $p$ was a normal distrubtion. With the normal identity in appendix bleh we were able to rearrange this nto a modified GP, with thecovariance matrix essentially inflated by the agent's uncertainty in its movement. 

Witht his inplace, we perofmrne a local imptps, constraint by the the opitmozer to lie on the unit circle.
