It seems cruel to inflict uncertainty on a robot - the only thing the poor machines have going for them is unflappable certainty born from a lack of imagination. However, such is the life of Bayesian.

I am working on a simple model of a small robot (Horace), exploring a world. Horace can move one unit of space in each time period (it is free to choose the direction). Its control system is not perfect, however, and Horace's future position is related to its control input by a normal distribution. 

More to follow!
